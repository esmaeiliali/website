# website

This is a website that I created for a professor at Isfahan University of Technology.
I used Html, CSS, Javascript and third party databases. This is not the final version of the website however it gives you an idea of what it would look like. During the design process, the professor asked that he would like users of Internet Explorer to be able to use it only. It is worth mentioning that the Javascript used in this website does not use any library.

Javascript or CSS was not used in the second website that I designed.
